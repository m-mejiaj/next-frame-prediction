# Next frame prediction

The project consists of predicting the next frame in a short movie sequence.

For this project, we shall use the Moving MNIST dataset, composed of 10,000 video sequences, each consisting of 20 frames. In each video sequence, two digits move independently around the frame, which has a spatial resolution of 64Ã—64 pixels. The digits frequently intersect with each other and bounce off the edges of the frame.

While each sequence has a lenght of 20, your are supposed to use only 3 consecutive frames as input, and predict the next one.

The metric used to evalaute the quality of the predicted frame is Mean Squared Error.
